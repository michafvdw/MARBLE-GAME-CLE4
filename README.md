NOTE: This project is still a work in progress.

This is code for an AR videogame for android with marbles. The game is made for children who's age ranges between 5-7. The game is supposed to help them learn how to read. For now the project includes: spawning of objects and plane tracking in AR, playing sound if an object is spawned or clicked on and moving a ball on your desktop on a plane and going to a new level if the right target is clicked. The project AR game includes the prototype of a AR marble game where the objects are automatically spawned, sound is played on awake and a ball can be thrown with a swipe function. The models for the marble lanes do not work yet. 

Code is made by: Sara van den Bos, Quinty de Jong, Owen Brouwer and Micha van der Willigen
